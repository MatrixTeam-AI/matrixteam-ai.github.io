The Matrix Dataset
------------------
The dataset comprises gameplay footage from two titles: Forza Horizon 5 (racing environments) and Cyberpunk 2077 (urban sci-fi environments).

- **Visual Content**:
   - Forza Horizon 5: Multi-scene driving sequences across deserts, oceans, water bodies, grasslands, and farmlands.
   - Cyberpunk 2077: Dense urban environments with skyscrapers, including day-night cycles and indoor-outdoor scenes (ratio: 1:3).
- **Resolution**: 2560×1600 (native resolution; higher resolutions may cause performance issues).
- **Frame Rate**: 60 FPS, ensuring smooth motion and fine-grained detail capture.
- **Data Volume**:
   - Forza Horizon 5: 1.2 million video-control signal pairs.
   - Cyberpunk 2077: 1 million video-control signal pairs.
- **Clip Duration**: All videos are segmented into standardized 6-second clips to align with model training requirements.

GameData Platform
-----------------
Control Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. **Automatic Control System**:
   - Uses Cheat Engine to access core game data (e.g., XYZ coordinates) for detecting stagnation.
   - Stagnation detection: If coordinates over a period fall within a predefined small circular area, the game resets and restarts recording.
   - Generates randomized control signals (movement, direction, perspective changes), effective for 2D/near-2D games but insufficient for 3D navigation due to challenges in producing coherent content.

2. **Manual Control System**:
   Deployed for 3D games via cloud servers:
   - Human operators observe gameplay via low-definition streams and send control signals (keyboard/mouse/gamepad inputs).
   - Signals are routed through a socket server, translated into virtual keyboard events on cloud servers.

Latency Handling:
   - Control signals and OBS video recording delays were measured to be ≤3 frames.
   - Delay is stable and linearly subtracted during timeline alignment.
