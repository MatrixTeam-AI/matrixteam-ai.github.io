Additional Notes
------------------------------
There have been certain changes to the hyperparameter settings and training strategy compared to what is reported in the paper due to the re-implementation. Please be aware of these when reviewing the code.

Despite these changes, we are pleased to announce that the overall generation quality is much more advanced compared to the previous version after more careful design of methods and parameters.
